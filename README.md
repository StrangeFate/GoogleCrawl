Google Search Crawler(up to 10 pages)

1. Clone it and download it onto your pc
2. Open up the Google_Search_Crawl.ipnyb
3. Checkout the example keyword file("example키워드.xlsx") and add keywords you need based on the structure of the example file
5. Follow the instructions in the Google_Search_Crawl.ipnyb
6. You can use multiple keyword files. At this time, crawler will read keyword files in sequence and do what it should do in sequence.

Known issue:
1. The crawler only crawl the 10 pages of the search result.
  - There was no need for more then 10 pages of search result when it was first made. 
  - Won't fix it till I get the request from the person who asked for.
